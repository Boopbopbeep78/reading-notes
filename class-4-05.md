- efficient when adding & removing most elements, but can be extrememly slow to search and find a single element

Linked lists are a linear data structure (sequence and an order to how they are constucted and traversed).

- linear structures is where items don't have to be arranged in order and the data structure can be traversed non-sequentially

Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly linked lists - based soley on the fact that they only go in one direction

2. Doubly linked lists - to hop between one node and the node previous without having to go back to the very beginning of the list
