# Javascript & JQuery Part 2

## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
- == "is equal to"
- != "is not equal to
- === "strict equal to"
!== "strict not equal to"
> "greater than
< "less than"
>= "greater than or equal to"
<= "less than or equal to"

## Comparison Operators
- In any condition, there is usually one operator and two operands.
    - (score >= pass)
    - score & pass are operands
    - >= is a comparision operator

Result will be true or false.

## Logical Operators
Allow you to compare the values of more than one comparison operator.

((5<2) && (2>= 3))

Above, the entire equation is an expression, as well as both problems.  

&& "Logical and"
|| "Logical or"
! "Logical not"

## Loops
Check a condition.  If it returns true, a code block will run.  This repeats until the condition returns false.

### 3 Common Types of Loops
1. For - for running code a specific # of times (most common)
1. While - for running code without knowing how many times
1. Do While - similar to while loop, but, main difference is it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once.

## Loop Counters
A for loop uses a counter as a condition, whic instructs the code to run a specified number of times.

### Condition is made up of 3 statements
1. Initialization - creates a variable and sets it to 0 (commonly called i)
1. Condition - loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a set #
1. Update - every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter
