# 4 Main Computer Actions
1. Input
1. Storage
1. Process
1. Output

# Binary & Data
- On/Off state called a "bit," which is smallest amount of info a computer can store
- Binary #'s are composed of 0's and 1's
- "9" in binary is "1001"
- Binary # system is "1010"
- 1(8s),0(4s),0(2s),1(1s)
- the more wires you use, the more #'s you can store
- with 8 wires, you can store #'s between 0 & 255
- images in binary are made with pixels via hexadecimal
- sound is represented on a wave, which have #'s

# Circuits
- Computers use circuits to process signals
- Not Circuits flip the signals (i.e. - from 0 to 1)
- And Circuits take 2 signals and will provide a 1 if both are 1
- 8-bit adders calcuate sums with 16 circuits
- Electricity moves at the speed of light

# CPU, Memory, Input, & Output
- CPU = central processing unit - handles processing of input, memory, processing & output

# Hardware & Software
- different commands tell CPU which circuits to use for which task
- software tells the CPU what to do
- OS is the master programs
