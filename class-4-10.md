# Stacks & Queues

**Stack:**
data structure that consists of nodes.

**Common Terminology:**
1. push - when nodes are put into the stack
1. pop - when nodes are removed from stack
1. top - top of the stack
1. peek - to view the value o the top node in the stack
1. isEmpty - returns true when stack is empty, otherwise returns false

**FILO**
first in last out

**LIFO**
last in first out

**Push O(1)**
pushing a node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many nodes you have in the stack

**Pop O(1)**
actionof removing a node from the top
    - typically would check isEmpty before popping to check for exceptions

**Peek O(1)**
- will only be inspecting the top node
-  will check isEmpty before conducting to check for exceptions

**Common Terminology for a Queue**
1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
1. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
1. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
1. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
1. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
1. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
