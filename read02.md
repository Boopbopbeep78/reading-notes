#What I Learned From The Reading Assignments

##Text Editors
Text editors are software used to write/save/store code, simply put.  They can be pretty basic (notepad on Windows or Text Edit on Mac, or, can come with a variety
of features like code completion or syntax highlighting and are generally free for the most part.  Syntax highlighting is a good way to oranize the different attributes
and elements of the code entered.

Additionally, some text editors have a built-in feature called Emmet which allows for shorthand coding.

All in all, it would make the most sense to use a text editor with these built in features alone. 

In addition to text editors, there are IDE's (Integrated Development Environment), which combine multiple different tools into one piece of software, which 
include a text editor, a file manager, compiler, and debugger.


##Command Line
A command line, or terminal, is a Linux GUI (graphical user interface), used to manually navigate one's computer.  The way it works is that you are provided with a 
prompt and you open a terminal, you enter in a command and modify the behavior via an option.

There is also a thing called a shell which is part of the OS and determines how the terminal will behave.

##Basic Navigation
Shortcuts include "pwd," "ls," & "cd." 
"pwd" means print working directory and
"ls" lists the contents of the directory.
"cd" means change directories and allows you to do that.

##About Files
ls - a lists the contents of a directory, along w/ hidden files.  Everything is a file under Linux.  Linux is an extensionless system and is also case sensitive.
