**1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**
- better program design and code quality
- detailed project documentation
- reduces the time required for project development

**2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**
- before an event to initialize the db and afterwards to clear the results from the db

**3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development**
- slow process
- cannot fix bugs for you

**4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**
- class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime & a prototype is an object instance

**5. Why REST?**
- code is easier than working with SOAP APIs

## Definitions

**functional programming**
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

**object-oriented programming (OOP)**
 programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

**class**
extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))

**super**
keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent.[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)

**this**
keyword pertains to the value it precedes
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

**Test Driven Development (TDD)**
a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

**Jest**
JS Testing framework [src](https://jestjs.io/)

**Continuous Integration (CI)**
the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

**REST**
 software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP that is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web service [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

**Data Model**
an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)
