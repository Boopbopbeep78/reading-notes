# CSS Layout

## Block-Level Elements
- start on a new line and act  the building block of any layout

## Inline Element
- flow in between surrounding text

## Containing Elemenets
- a box may be nested inside several other block-level elements.  The containing element is always the direct parent of that element.

## Positions of Elements

### Normal Flow
- default behavior of elements, whereby every block-level element is on its own line which causes each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

### Relative
- moves a block level element in a relative direction of where it should have been placed

### Absolute
- positions the element in relation to its containing element

### Fixed
- positions elements in a position relative to the browser window

### Floating
- takes element out of normal flow & position it to the far right or far left of the containing element
    - to clear a float, use ```clear```
