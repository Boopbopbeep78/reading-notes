##Markdown Definition from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists
are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

Content in the first column | Content in the second column

1. Bold
Syntax is "**" before a word and "**" after it to make it bold.
1. Italic
Syntax is "*" before a word and "*" after it to make it italic.
