# Introductory HTML 

## Structure
-	HTML describes the structure of pages
-	Elements are the building blocks
-	Attributes provide more context into what elements are (contain names & values)

## Extra Markup
-	In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags
-	Doctypes tell the browser which version of HTML the page is using
-	Comment syntax is “<--this is a comment-->”
-	Id’s used to uniquely identify and change an element
-	Class’s used to uniquely identify and change multiple elements
-	Escape characters used to type out symbols in HTML

## HTML Layout
-	HTML5 introduced new set of elements to divide up a page, notated by the kind of content (i.e. – page, content, etc)
-	Article element used for any standalone section
-	Aside element used when it relates to article, but isn’t essential
-	Section element groups related content together
-	Heading groups used to group together a set of one or more H tags
-	Figures (<figure> & <figcaption>) – used to contain any content referenced from main flow of an article

## Process & Design
-	Remember the target audience
- Determine what your visitors are trying to achieve

- What is a script? It's a series of instructions
- To write a script you must:
    1. Define the goal
    1. Design the scipt
    1. Code each step
- Objects are
- Properties are
- Events are
- Methods are
- Web browsers are programs built from objects
- Javascript runs where it's found in the HTML (browsers read from top to bottom)
- Scripts are first declared, then they must be invoked
