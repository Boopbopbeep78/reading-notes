## What Google Learned From Its Quest To Build The Perfect Team
- Google had lots of data, but, nothing that showed anything about the mix of personality types, skills, or backgrounds, meaning the "who" part of the equation didn't seem to matter

## How I Explained Rest To My Brother

- the web is built on an architectural style called "REST"
    - REST provides a definition of a "resource," which is what those things point to
    - a web page is a "representation" of a resource(concept)
    - URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere
    - Browser asks for a specific representation of the concept


- "Machines don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns."

- Polymorphism: concept in CS that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them

- Browsers really just GET stuff
