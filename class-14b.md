# What Google Learned About Teams

Great article.

My takeaway is that Google realized one very important missing aspect about the modern workplace: that employees should always be allowed to be themselves and communicate freely with their teams.  Collaboration is the most successful when the workplace is 'psychologically safe.'

I sent this article to a friend who's worked there for 10 years and she told me that this article is very accurate about how team dynamics work.

This is something that has been surely lacking from most of my career and I look forward to embracing this approach as I segue into tech.
