```“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." — John Outerhout```

### Functional Programming
- style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data [Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

#### Pure Functions
- returns the same result if give the same arguments(also referred to as deterministic)
- does not cause and observable side effects

### Immutability
- unchanging over time or unable to be changed

#### Referential Transparency
- a pure function will always have the same output, given the same input

#### Functions As First Class Entities
- functions are also treated as values and used as data
- functions as firs-class entities can:
    - refer to it from constants and variables
    - pass it as a parameter to other functions
    - return it as result from other functions
